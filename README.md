## Integrations
### Winston
If you would like to add a Winston log that accesses the API's Winston implementation, you may do the following
```javascript
let log = require('winston');
let transports = {
    file: {
        level: info,
        filename: '/tmp/smashgg-promise.log',
        handleExceptions: true,
        json: false,
        maxsize: 5242880, //5MB
        colorize: false
    },
    console: {
        level: debug,
        json: false,
        colorize: true,
        handleExceptions: true
    }
};

log.remove(log.transports.Console); //Remove the default implementation

log.add(log.transports.Console, transports.console); //Add new Console implementation
log.add(log.transports.File, transports.file); //Add new File implementation
```

## Tournament
A Tournament in smash-promise is a collection of Events, Phases, and Phases Groups that
categorize different games played, game types within those games, and the matches that
make up those games.

```javascript
var smashgg = Object;

smashgg.getTournament('to12')
    .then(to12 => {
        // Do stuff with tournament

are comprised of optional Phases and Phases Groups.

```javascript
smashgg.getEvent('to12', 'melee-singles')
    .then(to12event => { 
        to12event.getEventPhases().then(phases => {
            // Do stuff with event phases

    .catch(e => console.error(e));
```

a wave in pools is a Phase. Everything in that Phase is a Group (or Phase Group).

```javascript
let smashgg = Object;

smashgg.getPhase(100046)
    .then(to12phase => {
        var info = [

                value: to12phase.getName()
            },
            {
                key: 'EventId',
                value: to12phase.getEventId()
            }
        ]
    })
    .catch(e => console.error(e))
```

### Constructor

### Methods
#### Promises
* **getPhase()**
    * Returns a Promise that resolves a request to the smashgg API endpoint for that particular phase.

        // Do stuff with phase group
    })
    .catch(e => console.error(e));
```

    * **data** - the parsed data obtained from the XHR to the smashgg API.

### Methods
#### Promises
* **getPhaseGroup(id, expands)**

        to12.getAllMatches()
            .then(matches => {
